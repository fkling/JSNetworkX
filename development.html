    <p>JSNetworkX is an ambitious project and there is still a lot of work to 
    be done. <a href="api_progress.html">Only a small percentage of the NetworkX has been ported yet</a> and 
    reaching feature completeness is one of the top priorities. However, there
    are a couple of important architectural issues which are being worked on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div><strong>Generic node support</strong> <span class="label label-success">done</span></div>
        <p>Python can support any hashable data type as node value. The current
        implementation in JavaScript converts every value to a string, which
        is especially annoying when retrieving the nodes back again.</p>
        <p>Support for generic node values will be achieved through a forward 
        compatible implementation of 
        <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:simple_maps_and_sets">ES6 maps</a>.
        This implementation will differ from Python in that it will treat objects
        as generally hashable (by assigning a unique identifier). <del>Arrays will be considered
          as unhashable</del>. JSNetworkX will provide a Python <em>tuple</em> 
        compatible type for convenience.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <div><strong>Better and more flexible drawing API</strong> <span class="label label-info">active</span> </div>
      <p>JSNetworkX currently only supports drawing graphs as SVG with <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>.
      While the visualization can be set up to update if the graph is modified, it is not possible
      to bind the same graph to multiple visualizations or change options (such
      as the layout or node/edge styles) afterwards.</p>
      <p>The new drawing API will introduce a proper inheritance model which
      will simplify extension to support different visualization methods, such
      as WebGL (which is being worked upon as well, with <a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/">three.js</a>).
      It also allows to changes to to visualization (layout, style) after it was created.
      Important design goals for the new API and implementations are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Works "out of the box".</li>
        <li>Visualizations should be highly customizable, i.e. the should allow access to the underlying technology (SVG, WebGL) if desired.</li>
        <li>The interface should be as homogeneous as possible across different implementations/technologies.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <strong>Automatic generation of documentation/reference</strong> 
          <span class="label label-info">active</span>
          <p>There is currently no easily browse-able documentation available.
          While the API that JSNetworkX currently implements is kept closely to 
          the original API and therefore the <a href="http://networkx.github.com/documentation/latest/reference/index.html">NetworkX documentation</a>
          can be use, <a href="documentation.html">are some differences</a> and 
          future changes might introduce even more differences.
          </p>
          <p>The source code is fully documented and contains the same information
          as the original Python code, so generating accessible documentation
          with <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/">JSDoc</a> is possible.
          
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div><strong>Explicit Node.js support</strong> <span class="label label-success">done</span></div>
        <p>JSNetworkX was started with the intention to simplify the visualization
        of graph data in the browser. Some NetworkX methods make use of functionalities
        typically not found in browser. However, Node.js is becoming increasingly
        popular and some of these functionalities are available in Node.js (such as file system
        support).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div><strong>Support long running processes</strong> <span class="label label-success">done</span></div>
        <p>Complex computations which require long running processes usually don't
        pose any problems on the server. In the browser though, long running processes
        will freeze the page.</p>
        <p>The typical approach to this problem is to provide some kind of callback
        API for the calling code and perform the computation asynchronously. I
        believe this is the right approach here as well and try to find a solution
        which allows any algorithmic method to be easily converted to work 
        asynchronously.
